# üì© SMS Spam Detection Web Application

This project presents a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based web application developed using a Machine Learning model to detect whether an SMS is **spam** or **not spam**. The app is simple, lightweight, and built with Streamlit, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users for quick message screening.

---

## Objective

The primary goal of this application is to provide an effective tool for classifying SMS messages as spam or not spam using a trained machine learning model. It aims to help users filter out unwanted messages and enhance security against fraud and scams.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a text message (SMS) into the input field.
2. The application:
   - Preprocesses the text (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
   - Transforms the text into numeric features using TF-IDF vectorization
   - Predicts whether the message is spam or not using a trained ML model
3. The result is displayed on the interface.

## Advantages

- High accuracy (~95.74%) on real-world SMS data
- Clean, minimal, and user-friendly interface
- Fast and responsive predictions
- Easy to deploy and extend for more use cases
